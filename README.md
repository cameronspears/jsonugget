# jsonugget

## Description

`jsonugget` is a lightweight utility for summarizing the structure of JSON files. It scans through your JSON file and generates a summary that shows the types and keys without exposing any sensitive data. This is particularly useful for sharing the structure of a JSON document without sharing the actual data it contains.

## Features

- Deep scans nested JSON structures
- Summarizes JSON objects and arrays
- Sterilizes sensitive data, only exposing types and keys
- Saves the summary as a new JSON file
- User-friendly terminal interface

## Installation

1. Download the latest `.exe` from the Releases page.
2. Place the `.exe` in your desired directory.

## Usage

Simply run `jsonugget.exe` and follow the on-screen instructions to select a JSON file. The program will generate a summary and save it in your Downloads folder as `nugget_TIMESTAMP.json`.
